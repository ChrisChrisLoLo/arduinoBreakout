ACCESSORIES:
* Arduino Mega Board (AMG)
* LCD display
* Kingston flash memory card - 8 GB - microSDHC (MUST BE FORMATTED TO FAT, as well as contain the file "SCORE.txt")
* SainSmart JoyStick Module
* Potentiometer
* Passive Piezo Buzzer With Long Leads (speaker)
NOTE: potentiometer is connected to the buzzer

HOW TO RUN:
	1. Plug in the Arduino into the computer and wire it properly
	2. Take the SCORE.txt file found in this folder and place it onto the SD card. Make sure the SD card has FAT
		formatting it on it. Place the SD card into the LCD display.
	3. Use the terminal to open up which directory the file is and use "make upload"
	4. Wait for it to upload *WARNING* for some reason, the SD card will take a while to load on first boot up.
		This will result in the lcd displaying white for a short amount of time. Please wait up to half a minute
		and DO NOT RESET, or the score file will be wiped.
	5. Enjoy Animated Interactive Desctruction Simulator!

CONTROLS:
While in game:
* press joystick button to start game
* you can move joystick left and right to play the game
* the trimpot controls volume

While in name selection:
* you can go up and down on the joystick to choose a letter to type.
* press the button to "lock in" your chosen letter, you cannot go back
	once locked in.
* lock in three times to choose your name.

While in scoreboard:
* press joystick button to reset and play the game again.

DIVISION OF CODE:
For quick reference, there are three modes and three set-ups related to each.

-Gameloop(mode 0) and mode0Setup():
	*Sets up the game loop be resetting variables and drawing shapes. gameLoop() is
	the loop in which the game plays
-mode1() and mode1Setup():
	*Game overscreen, changes from 0 to 1 when ball hits floor.
-mode2() and mode2Setup();
	*Score list, which displays all hi-scores

WIRING INSTRUCTION:
LCD screen:

Board pin <---> Arduino pin
---------------------------
GND             GND
Vin             5V
3Vo             NOT CONNECTED
CLK             52
MISO            50
MOSI            51
CS              10
D/C             9
RST             NOT CONNECTED
Lite            NOT CONNECTED
Y+              A2 (analog pin)
X+              4  (digital pin)
Y-              5  (digital pin)
X-              A3 (analog pin)
IM0 - IM3       NOT CONNECTED (they expect a 3.3v signal, DON'T CONNECT!)
CCS             6
CD              NOT CONNECTED

JoyStick Module:

Board pin <--> Arduino pin
----------------------------
GND            GND
5v             5v
VRx            A1
VRy	       A0
SW	       2


Piezo Buzzer With Long Leads and potentiometer
-----------------------------------------------
Arduino pin 12 <--> |potentiometer| <--> GND
middle of potentiometer <--> buzzer <--> GND

*It should be noted that the wiring is exactly the same as assignment 2,
save the piezo and potentiometer. The piezo acts as a speaker for the game to play sounds
while the trimpot is optional and is used for volume control. one can directly wire the
buzzer to pin 12 and ground if one so chooses.
